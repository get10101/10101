//! A socket handling library for those running in Tokio environments who wish to use
//! rust-lightning with native [`TcpStream`]s.
//!
//! Designed to be as simple as possible, the high-level usage is almost as simple as "hand over a
//! [`TcpStream`] and a reference to a [`PeerManager`] and the rest is handled".
//!
//! The [`PeerManager`], due to the fire-and-forget nature of this logic, must be a reference,
//! (e.g. an [`Arc`]) and must use the [`SocketDescriptor`] provided here as the [`PeerManager`]'s
//! `SocketDescriptor` implementation.
//!
//! Three methods are exposed to register a new connection for handling in [`tokio::spawn`] calls;
//! see their individual docs for details.
//!
//! [`PeerManager`]: lightning::ln::peer_handler::PeerManager

// Prefix these with `rustdoc::` when we update our MSRV to be >= 1.52 to remove warnings.
