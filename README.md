# 10101 - One app, all things bitcoin

10101 combines the power of a self-custodial on-chain and off-chain wallet with the vast world of trading. 10101 - a numeral palindrome and the binary representation of 21 - as in 21 million possible bitcoin. The vision of 10101 embodies what Bitcoin stands for: Decentralized and censorship resistant money.
